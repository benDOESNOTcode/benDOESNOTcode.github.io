Introduction
We’ve all seen harrowing images: ducks entangled in plastic, turtles mistaking plastic bags for jellyfish, 
and large fish like tuna found with plastic in their stomachs. A staggering study revealed that in 2010, 
an estimated 4.8 to 12.7 million metric tons of plastic entered the oceans. But what about now, fourteen years later?
 Have we made progress, or has the problem worsened?

Our study explores two critical aspects of this crisis: the impact of microplastics on phytoplankton and whether fishing vessels
have altered their routes in response to pollution hotspots.

Why Plankton?
Why focus on phytoplankton, these tiny, 
often-overlooked ocean organisms? Their role in the ecosystem is far more significant than their size suggests.

Phytoplankton are among the primary producers of oxygen in our oceans, playing a pivotal role in maintaining the Earth's oxygen supply. 
They also act as natural carbon sinks, sequestering carbon dioxide and mitigating the effects of climate change. 
As renowned oceanographer John Martin famously stated, “Give me half a tanker of iron, and I will give you an ice age,”
emphasizing the critical role of phytoplankton in regulating the Earth's climate. Additionally, these colorful,
microscopic organisms are the foundation of marine food webs, providing nourishment for small schooling fish and,
in turn, sustaining larger marine life.
